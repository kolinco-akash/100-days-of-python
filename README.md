# 100 Days of Python

## Overview
Welcome to the 100 Days of Python challenge! This repository is a personal project aimed at enhancing Python programming skills through consistent practice over 100 days.

## Purpose
The purpose of this challenge is to:

- Strengthen fundamental Python concepts.
- Explore advanced Python topics.
- Build practical projects to apply the learned concepts.

## Structure
The repository is organized into directories for each day, numbered from Day 1 to Day 100. Each day contains:

- Python scripts or notebooks (.py or .ipynb files) showcasing code written during that day.
- Documentation or notes about the concepts covered.
- Projects or mini-projects related to the day's focus.


## Content
The content covered in this challenge includes (but is not limited to):

- Basics of Python (variables, data types, loops, conditionals).
- Functions and modules.
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
- File handling.
- Libraries and frameworks (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc.).
- Web scraping.
- GUI development.
- Database integration.
- Deployment and automation.

## How to Use This Repository
Feel free to explore the code and notes for each day. If you're also participating in the 100 Days of Python challenge, you can:

- Fork this repository.
- Modify the code to suit your learning style or add additional notes.
- Share your own progress or challenges faced through issues or pull requests.
